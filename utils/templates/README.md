# Templates

Useful template directories.

## [c-project](c-project/)

Basic C project directory with a simple Hello-World c program and a generic
makefile that can be used to compile any C project so long as it does not
require static/dynamic linking with external non-standard libraries, although it
can probably be modified to do so using pkg-config.

## [c-dotfiles](c-dotfiles/)

Useful C project configuration files.
